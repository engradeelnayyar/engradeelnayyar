### CSS Comments
  We can comment in CSS as below:
```css

### CSS Gradient
: Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:
```css
  gradient-type(
    color1,
    color2
    );
```  
 In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next.
