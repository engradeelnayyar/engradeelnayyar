```js
    let student = {
        name: "Khurram", 
        marks: 1000, 
        class: "B.Com",
    }
```

In the below code this object is used in below function to create a string ```Khurram secured 1000 marks in B.Com.``` that will be output when ```logData``` function is called.

function logData() {
       console.log(student.name + " secured " + student.marks + " marks in " + student.class + "."
  }
    logData()
```
