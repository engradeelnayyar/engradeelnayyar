### CSS Comments
  We can comment in CSS as below:
```css

```
### Gradient
Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:
```css
  gradient-type(
    color1,
    color2
    );
```  
 In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next.  
 You can specify where you want a gradient transition to complete by adding it to the color like this:
```css 
gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2 20%,
  color3
);
```
Here, it will transition from color1 to color2 between 0% and 20% of the element and then transition to color3 for the rest.
